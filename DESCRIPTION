Description: Implements Vector Symbolic Architecture (VSA) primitives to 
    support experimentation. Design choices are Ross Gayler's personal 
    preferences for a simple experimental system (The VSA equivalent of the
    geneticist's fruitfly). Vector elements are phasors (unit magnitude complex
    numbers). There are some extra features intended to support non-negativity.
